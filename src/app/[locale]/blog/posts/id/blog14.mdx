# The Purpose of gaming

8th January

Play is an integral part of the human experience. It’s how babies learn to grow and bond with their family members. How young boys learn about camaraderie between brothers and how we transition into manhood. It is the soul within our social nature to want to engage in play with our fellow human beings. It is the silly humanness within us that makes us want to play. To want to skip when we see a stone. Hop on one leg at times, and then out of nowhere, jump and skip and pop. As we grow older, we don’t do this much. However, these are very important for our well-being from a physical and mental standpoint. Also, the times have changed. The games we play have become much more digital than physical. We don’t play physically as we used to, but we do engage in many digital games. The play we do while engaging with people in sports or just messing around may not be the same as this form of play. But, it is play nonetheless.

Firstly, I shall mourn the death of physical play. It is a passage of life to be able to enjoy your body to the fullest. When you jumped rope as a kid, you had no idea about which position would be the best, whether you should bend your knees or not, or how you should jump and when to avoid getting smacked by the rope. You just jumped rope, and if you failed and the rope got tangled across your body, you just untangled it and then moved on with your merry day. You didn’t think that you’d get tired after running. You just ran as fast as you could, as if nobody was watching. Your purpose wasn’t to run this many kilometers to lose this many calories. Your purpose was to just move. Nowadays, every movement has a purpose. You are not solely doing it because you want to enjoy what your body is capable of doing. You are doing it cause it’s something that’s good for you, something that will help you reach your goal. Movement has become a chore rather than a method of play.

Now comes the digital games we play. Has it also metamorphosed into being a chore rather than an activity of engagement? Single-player games used to be a way to vicariously live the lives of other entities. We have been Assassins of medieval times, the price of Persia, the witcher that slayed monsters, a gangster trying to make his way to the top in a vice city, a vengeful warrior on a quest to kill the god of war, a broken warrior navigating through the world filled with rot, a monkey on his quest to get his power back, and a pokemon trainer trying to become the best in the world. Through games, we are able to live lives that we can only fathom in fiction. We don’t simply play those games; we walk in the murky waters. We feel the pain they have felt. The emotions of being able to parkour through the buildings of Italy or sliding down the pyramids of Egypt, I have been able to feel like I was able to experience that time period through the eyes of a person who may or may not have been there. I am able to understand what the atmosphere could have been like, what people lived in such places, and what events could have transpired that led to this story being told. For me, games have enabled me to live a hundred lives that I could never have experienced on my own.

But, the crux of today’s matter is the purpose of repetitive games that hold no other value than the rounds that we play. I am talking about Counter-Strike, dota, valiant, League of Legends, deadlock, and so on. It’s just the implementation of a bunch of characters in a specific scenario with the provision of a certain number of variations. There is a ranking system, and you grind your way to reach a higher rank. There is no greater purpose to this game. You are not trying to live the life of some other character. You are simply using that character to reach a specific goal. The character is simply a tool for you to use rather than a life that you embody. Walk in and commit actions to the world at large. You can’t walk away from it. It’s a closed-world scenario where you can’t choose to lay down your weapons and run and be free in the world. It’s just slop created to be enjoyed for the moment. Mindless games that are made just to grab money from people.

I played Valorant today. This made me wonder what was the purpose of my playing it. Yes, I get to catch up with the people I play with, but what more? Should games be just a brainless medium that runs in the background? We can use it as a buffer to communicate amongst ourselves. Can’t we just do it without some boring ass game that requires no operating brain capacity running in the background to just be present and tell each other how life is going and what are the things that ail us? Maybe the games, as such, aren’t much about play itself. But it provides a platform that gives the illusion of play so that people can come together and unite for a purpose. It is not gathering around the football ground and playing football. But, it’s a ground that we all can come to easily. We all can join the game and pretend that we are there mostly to play the game. Even though most of the time, we are simply talking about life, college, and how we start another Spanish revolution. The monotonous game provides the same platform every time. But because of the monotony of the game, we boys are able to express ourselves in what otherwise would have been an impossible task.
