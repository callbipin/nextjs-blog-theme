# The Dragon

29th December

At the starting of the week, I am filled with emotions I can’t fathom. I am trying to get my life in order. For that, I need a list. I don’t understand the concept of having a list for the sake of having a list. I should make a list, though. There are certain things I want to start this year. I want to change who I am as a person. I want to conduct metamorphism into a being that is more than the person writing this blog. But how is that achievable? Through arduous training? Through stringent discipline? Those are things that a warrior should do. Practice their craft every single day with fervent passion. That way, when the time for battle arrives, the warrior shall be able to draw out his sword and face his enemies.

I realised I don’t like saying slaying the dragon. I find dragons or the idea of dragons to be quite fascinating. Imagine a creature so powerful it is feared by many. It has scales that no one or nothing can penetrate. It likes to stay alone in the deep caves of the mountains. Soars high across the sky and is almost always trying to bring destruction when people see it. To add on top of it, it breathes fire. It’s a miraculous, marvellous, and tantalising concept. Tell me you don’t feel shivers down your spine when you hear Dragon. But the truth of the matter is Dragons don’t exist. And we don’t slay dragons.

Slaying the dragon is the metaphor used by people in self-development communities to talk about overcoming the problems we have in our lives. This could be something as simple as waking up in the morning or something monumental like creating a six-pack abs by training in a specific way to achieve that physique that one always dreams of. For me, maybe it’s because I am a writer and love words, what dragon represents is something way more magical, mystical, and magnificent that I can’t simply use that word to describe something that’s rubbish. Dragons are wonderful, and I am neither a night nor a hero. I am Hiccup. I would rather tame, nay, become friends with the Dragon rather than slay them.

What does that mean for my life, though? How do I see the things, the objects, entities, behaviours, and patterns in my life that I want to overcome, change, or rid myself of? There needs to be a way to present them. If I do not verbalise them, they do not exist. I must present them in the real world. Give them specific ideas, concepts, and bodies that they can embody. Then and only then will I be able to properly cut them down, defeat them, and vanquish them from my life. What would be an apt word or words? I fail to find them at the current moment. But maybe someday I will be able to jot them down. Able to give birth to them. Just to slay them. It is quite an intriguing idea, I dare say. I, being the creator of evil, and I, being the one who destroys them. Is that what a man is? The creator and the destroyer of oneself.

The word Creator has changed its meaning in recent times. It no longer means what it used to mean. But, I am surprised women never picked up this word. Till now, all of the world’s people were given birth to by women. Yet, women never called themselves the creator. But where do men find the audacity to call “Father, all creator”? It does make sense, given the arrogance of men and the idea of being a King, that they would need to become the all-creator. Are men the creator and not women? I can see that men built society, but I always come back to the idea that a man builds a house and a woman makes it a home. If I were to take traditional masculine and feminine energy, I can see that the synergy gives this idea of what makes life worth living. We can have modern, ugly architecture, but we do need a bit of feminine energy to make it look better. If I look at the world, I can see that we do lack a lot of feminine energy in droves nowadays.

What is the purpose of slaying a dragon? Of overcoming a task greater than yourself? To say you have made it? I did something. For me, I am reminded of the masculinity of Nwet Scammander from Harry Potter. Well, Fantastic Beasts and where to find them. In it, Nwet isn’t a masculine superhero. He is all about being kind and gentle and understanding fantastic beasts. When the ending of the movie is reached, spoiler alert, the monster is destroyed, and in doing so, Nwet has failed as a hero. His purpose was never to slay the dragon but to save it. This idea keeps on resonating in my mind.

Why must we slay dragons? Can’t we save it? Can’t we save ourselves from the ailments that harm us? Everyone talks about metamorphosis. As if they need to become another being in order to reach the pinnacle of who they are. But can’t we just upgrade a few parts of who we are to reach that level? I have more questions today than I have answers. But maybe tomorrow I will have answers. We never know what the answers might be. Or if there are indeed answers to the question.

Today’s ramble is a little bit out of place because it was written in three or four sittings. I have come to realise that this exercise must be done in one sitting to ensure consistency in my ideas. The thoughts flow like a river without any dams in between. Maybe tomorrow we will have it. Tonight, we rest.
