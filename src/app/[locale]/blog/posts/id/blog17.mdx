# Falling off the wagon

11th January

Fula jasti meri maya. The phrase means, my lover who is like a flower. Metaphors are often used hap-hazardously in songs. Truth be told, I still get confused between what a simile is and what metaphors are. Don’t you? I would have to google to know the difference but I promised myself because I have not written in 3 days, I would do this in one sitting. I would not get distracted by anything or anyone. So, my dear reader, if you are someone who doesn’t know what the difference between what a simile is and what are metaphors, there are two of us now? I guess we are as clueless as a rich blonde girl who never had to take much responsibilities in life. I don’t say that to be sexist, or make any insinuation that blonde people have a relatively lower IQ. It’s just easier to imagine that character because of pop culture and the occasional person you encounter in your real life. I don’t want to be stereotypical but I can say with certainty that you have encountered such a person. The one that makes you scratch your head and ponder, how did this person survive this long despite being clueless?

I know, I know. I am digressing as I normally do from the crux of the matter. I fell off the wagon. After watching Loudermilk, I have started to see myself as someone who is an addict. Someone who is indeed of therapy in order to become better than who I currently am. I do not have a sponsor or a support group. But, I think to an extent that is what would help me beat my addiction. The addiction I am talking about, whichever name you choose to adorn it with, is my procrastination, my ADHD, my unwillingness to do what must be done. When I look at all of these people in this tribes of wannabe-alphas, are they seeking the same thing? The idea of belonging to a tribe. Have sponsors i.e. their bros that keep them in check. Create a group where they give themselves to a higher cause and forsake their free will to become someone better than who they are. Alas, we all are seeking for community that provides us with therapy from who we are. The person who are is not the person which we imagined ourselves to be or want to be. Therefore, we give ourselves to be better through the combine effort of the tribe. With the occasional, killing of one’s old self in the process.

That is quite interesting. If therapy was messaged in a different way than would men be more open to coming to therapy? Many alcoholics got to AA meetings which is a form of therapy. There you will find many guys there who will admit that drinking is a problem. If we were to say the same about other forms of therapy, would we have people, moreover men, coming to therapy more. Let’s give it a shot, shall we? Why don’t we call couple’s counseling, “Can you win an argument against your wife with logic?”. Many married men I know would love to have a referee concur that their wives are being irrational. They would happily join counseling if they thought it was a place to go argue with logic. Put out all the feelings that cause people to act and react in certain ways and how that may be detrimental to the relationship. Instead of gender class: Teaching the values of both gender, why don’t we say something along the lines of, “How easy is it to be a woman?” and make the men experience all the harassment that woman face in work places. They will not come if we tell them the second part. We will have to make the title sound like we are mocking woman to get them into the classroom and once you got them, bang! You dress them up in fake tities and a short skirt and you grab ‘em by the balls.

Back to the topic at hand, I am treating myself like someone who has addiction. It is high time I think I did. I have problems that are causing me to not live the life that I want. I am not able to enjoy my well being by being this person. Seeing this, it would not be far off to assume, I am someone who is addicted to being lazy, cheap dopamine, and a large disregard for life. In my understanding, I have found out that the only proper way forward is to treat myself like an addict and work accordingly to rehabilitate me. I am constantly chasing a high from one source or the other and I am never satiated cause I have fried my dopamine circuits. In order for me to properly function, I need to understand my triggers, reset my habits and be in full control of what I am doing. In doing so, I will be able to have a better control of my life and be able to live the life that I want.

For the first step, I am making right of all the wrong things I have done. I have not written for 3 days now. I normally write for one day before. So, if it’s the 14th, I write of the 13th. But, today, since we are moving towards the right path, we are going to do a little bit more. I know, I know. This is the thing I normally do. Procrastinate a lot at the beginning and then at the end, I end up doing more than necessary. The same is with workouts. The same is with cycling. The same is with eating. There isn’t a balance of doing a little every single day. It’s more about doing a lot when you feel like it and doing nothing when I don’t feel like it. This needs to change.
