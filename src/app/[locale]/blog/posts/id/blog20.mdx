# Uptown funk you up

14th January

This is the ice cold; Michele fights for that white gold. I never understood the meaning of this song.

It is early in the morning, and the Mac is cold. I can’t even properly type anything, and when I graze the surface of this metal box, I feel a surge of chill down my hands. I appreciate this being a great device with a good battery and better performance, but on winter mornings like today, I miss the old intel-based Macbooks. They would warm you up, and I knew a way or two to make sure that they would be warm. It was a good device for winter. Now, this Macbook is just hard to use. I don’t want to type anymore because I can feel the cold every time I put my hands anywhere on its surface. I know; I will touch type with my hands above the keys. Then I will just press down on the required keys like it’s a bloody piano. I have not played the piano in quite a while. I wanted to learn and be better, but I did not have a goal or a pathway. This has made it very difficult for me to approach the piano.

Talking about my daily habit for 2025, the only thing I have been consistently doing is writing. It has helped me a lot, but I don’t find myself being truthful in these words. For example, I am not saying that I have not practiced the piano in a long time. There were a few days when I would practice hand drills and just some scales. But these days, I have not even been doing that. I do use the Complete Music Reading Trainer app to learn how to read sheet music, but I believe it is not enough for me to become better at the piano. I need to actively sit in front of it and then apply myself. Speaking of applying myself, I need to find a new job. I don’t need a lot of money, but I just need enough to be comfortable. I just want to be able to make anything about $2896 per month. Currently, I make one-seventh of that. That is quite a jump in the money I make, but it would be enough for me to stop thinking about other avenues of income and just focus on my hobbies. In the post-AI world, I wonder how things would change.

I have been wondering about the post-AI world. Where Robotics has reached its peak. This could be somewhere from 5 to 50 years from now on. Imagine autonomous robots that join the workforce. These robots would be able to work in factories. Produce goods and services twenty-four seven three sixty-five. There would be factories of robots working towards creating factories of robots. All of these robots would be utilized in mining, gathering resources, building infrastructure, and improving the economy. This is the utopian world I look towards. A place where robots can help make this world a better place. Sometimes, I think I am a bit too naive to think that.

The first time I went to India, I was astonished by the scale at which they operated. I was in Nepal, which had one terminal and one runaway. I landed at Delhi International Airport, and the first thing I observed was obviously the smell. The country smelled a lot. Then, the other thing I noticed was how massive the whole country was. I have been to a few remote places in Nepal, and I know that for puny humans like ourselves, the world is very massive. Sure, we can try to walk around it, but we can’t properly walk all around the globe without investing a significant portion of our lives specifically in that task. At least, that is what I thought before I landed at that airport. The runway was so long, and I saw massive plane after plane after plane. To me, it was so wonderful to be able to see such a sight.

The exploration of India really changed my mind about abundance. We can have a world full of abundance. Yes, there are and always will be people who are greedy and try to hog all the resources for themselves. But we have a way to counteract that now. We are not dependent on the intelligence of humans to make that decision. We are dependent upon the intelligence of a greater intelligence that we have created. I know AI gets a bad rep cause people have been using AI to copy artists and replace writers. I was supposed to first be able to do my laundry and dishes. Maybe look after the kids. Things that people don’t want to bother themselves with. Especially taking care of the kids. Nasty buggers. But AI did the thing of putting food on the table for people. I mean, it was inevitable. Soon, my job will also be taken away by AI. I am just waiting for the day that happens, to be honest. Why am I waiting for AI to do that, I do not know?

There are things I want to pursue, but they are mostly hobbies. Hobbies do make money for a specific amount of people, but will that be for me? I have no idea. People say you can try, but I find myself being stopped by something. I can’t properly articulate it, but I find myself not being engaged in the things I want to be doing. I am always looking for a new stimulus. Always distracted with something new. I do not even derive happiness from some new thing that pops up in my feed. But I find my life being dictated by something or someone I can not control. Just another being inside of me that’s controlling me.
