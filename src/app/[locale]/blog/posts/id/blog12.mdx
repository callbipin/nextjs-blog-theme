# The Purpose of Sysiphean tasks

The purpose of Sysiphean tasks

When I first started going to the gym, I thought it was stupid. I honestly didn’t want to go. A friend took me along with him. I didn’t really get why people used to work out or what working out was. So, what do you do to work out? You take a dumbbell, and then you move it up and down 12 times. You rest for a minute. And then you get back to moving the dumbbell in that specific manner. That was working out. Which was not working out for me. Imagine doing a task such as moving something up just to put it back down again. In the same motion. If you know something about Greek stories, you would know that doing so is nothing but a curse from the Gods. It’s a way to punish us. And when I sometimes hurt my back, I think it is the way in which God is punishing us for not working out properly. Not indulging in the Sisyphean task of moving an object up just to have it come down again and then push it back up again.

It was later on I realised how much of a fool I was. The idea of one must imagine Sisphyus happy is not what I am pointing towards. That’s still a stupid idea. But I can see why we need such tasks in our life. Why do we need to engage in tasks that are seemingly repetitive and don’t serve a larger-than-life purpose? Engaging in tasks that just don’t seem worthwhile. Let me give you a simple example of your room. Has there been any week that your room has been cleaned all throughout the month? Yes, you clean it one day. And then, in a few days, you clean it again or at least brush up on it. But, sooner or later, give it a month’s time, and you will see, and of no fault of your own, that your room has become a mess again. Well, why clean your room if it’s going to be messy again. Why exercise if you are just going to grow weak once you stop or grow old? Why push the boulder up the hill, knowing that it will come rolling back down again?

One must imagine Sisphysus to be happy? No, but one must imagine how ripped he must be. That boulder does not look small in any of the pictures that are painted by artists. It is always shown as a boulder that is bigger than him. If you know the knees over toes guy, you know he is properly pushing that boulder with his knees as well. It’s a full-body exercise. In every depiction of the painting, you can see that Sisphysus is quite jacked. That is because the artists didn’t lack imagination. Tell me honestly, there is a guy, and all he does is go to the gym. He pushes a heavy boulder with his hands, his knees bent to provide the required force; the back is engaged, and the core is engaged, from the glutes to the hamstrings. You can see it is taking all out of him to push this boulder. And let him do that for eternity. Would he or would he not be ripped? This is the purpose of Sisphyian tasks. To be ripped.

Now, this applies to other contexts as well. When you start cleaning your room for the first time, you do not know what needs to be done. Heck, you don’t even know if your room is dirty or just mismanaged. But, every time you make an effort to clean, you find places to put stuff. You organize what needs to go where. You start folding your clothes to put them in their proper place. You move stuff around so that each thing has a place, and things that don’t are thrown out. Your wardrobe makes sense. You just put the things you are going to wear closer to you. You are going to put the things that you will need for special occasions in a proper hanger so that it doesn’t get wrinkles. Similarly, with exercise, you don’t know what you are doing at first. The first time you do a push-up, you will be lucky to be, at the very least, just gasping for air. Then you go to the gym and do your first leg day, then you won’t have legs for the next couple of days. You slowly learn what needs to be done. What’s the purpose of proper form. What’s the effect of your body being under stress. How they grow, how they make you feel energized. It’s a slow and steady step, but every time you roll the boulder up the hill, you will learn how better to roll the boulder up the hill.

I think this is the reason a lot of people are unhappy in their current jobs. They find that they are rolling the boulders up the hill every single day, and they are not learning or gaining anything. They have no muscles to flex regarding how competent they have become at their job. They do not have a heavy boulder. It’s just a small one that they can roll up the hill with no effort and make the task just seem too God damn easy. Their boulders are not heavy, and neither is the hill they climb on. As a result, their muscles don’t grow. They have no sense of accomplishment when they are able to push that boulder to the top of the hill. They just feel meh because their boulders don’t challenge them.

We should all aim to be like Sisyphus. Not only do we imagine that we are happy, but we embrace the boulders that we push every single day up the mountain. With every step we take, we learn how to push the boulder up the mountain better. The better form for the proper development of the required muscles for pushing. I imagine then there will come a day when we don’t need to push the boulder up the hill. We will just be rolling it upwards. Or on the days we are lazy, just throw it to the top of the hill.

The Gods may have cursed us. But we shouldn’t curse ourselves. We shouldn’t be sad that we need to push this boulder up the hill every day. We should embrace it. Knowing, we will be able to push it better the next day.
