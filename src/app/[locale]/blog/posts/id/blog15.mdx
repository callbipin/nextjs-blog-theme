# The Purpose of walking

9th January

I walked 13008 steps today

Today was a normal day like any other. I woke up a bit late. Rushed to college. Sat in class comprehending if this is what I really wanted out of life? Went to office. Did the normal tasks and by the end of it, I had finished what was needed to be done. After that I went out with some friends where we discussed what can we do with our lives. Nothing fruitful came out of it except for the 13k steps I walked today. Then I went to go pick up my sister and then came home. It was already late. Mum and Dad already hit the hay. I warmed up the food, ate it, did the dishes, and came to my room. The young lad whom I gave a chatbot project called me. He was interested in knowing what kind of database configuration to keep for the chat logs. Given they are very small files, anything that gives free space, proper security and ability to scale with minimal cost should be enough was my answer. We want it to have the ability to do more. But, for now, we just want it to be a storage that’s free. So, MongoDB it is. He had a bunch of new ideas but I said it’s best to implement what we know given we are both familiar with MERN.

Finally, the call ended. I sent a goodnight voice memo to my girlfriend cause I think she fell asleep. I hope she did. She was feeling a lot of pain due to cramps. I want what’s best for her. Then I came to my bed. To say that today has been a long day would be an understatement. I am so sleepy right now. I am trying my best to keep my eyes wide open so that I can write another word on this blank canvas and not have it be empty. The question I have been asking myself is why? Why am I making this if this is not properly reciprocated by the people who read it. That adds another question to the mix, what is the way in which my words would be reciprocated? I don’t think I even know the meaning of the word reciprocated at this time. I thank the person who made spell checker. My eye lids weight a ton and I have having a hard time to keep my eyes wide open.

But even with all of the ailments facing me at the moment, why did I decide to get out of my bed, open my laptop and open Notion. Just so that I can gargle up a few sentences that are no way of my own but a culmination of everything I have consumed mentally. There is no purpose of pushing myself to think and be able to writer especially when I am in such a sad state. Especially, when I am in a state in which I can fall asleep at any moment.

There are some people that are energised by the night. A lot of extroverts specially like the night for I don’t know what it brings to them, but you can feel their face light up as dawn approaches or was it dusk. I always confuse between the two. Which is dawn and which is dusk. But, as I write this, I remember the song by Zyan Malik. The song goes, “You will never be alone. I will be with you from dusk till dawn.” To be honest, this confuses me even more. Is Zyan saying that he will be there from her from the morning to the evening. Like a nine to five job? Or is he saying he will come in the evening and leave tomorrow morning because he has a job and has to go to work at 9 AM and be back at 5 PM to be with her again when Dusk starts.

There was a story named Dusk in one of the books we read. I don’t know if it was Gulmohor or English Literature. Growing up and going to a somewhat good school because your Dad worked in court and helped the principal with their court helped people. I, despite not being well off, as a kid was able to be in a place where all the rich kids would go to for school. I don’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. But, I do know one of the good aspects of it was that I got to read a lot of stories as we would have English II as well just for stories and poems and all that matters in life. In that book was the story of Dusk. To be honest, I don’t remember what that story was about. I only remember the coffee chocolate incident. The time when a man sits on the place next to his colleague. It can be his workplace or simply two guys who just met. Then there is a chocolate chip cookies in a packet nearby. What happens is the protagonist eats the chips and the old man looks at him strange and starts eating the chocolate chip cookies as well. Both of them are frustrated that there is rude guy who is eating my chocolates. I remember how it ended. The grandpa just walks away to reveal a piece of chocolate that the other had promised.

This has been the most grueling exercise I have ever done. And trust me, I have done my fair share of hard exercises. At the weight of 85 kg, I was the one that went on trek to Langtang valley. On that trip, I lost 4 kgs of weight. I eventually have gotten it back but reminds me that we can loose weight. For me, it was also me able to walk on treks. I don’t think I have fully been able to recover but I will slowly reach there.
