# The Teacher

30th December

So, I woke up at 10:50 to get started on this. I do not know why. I do know why. It’s because when I started this, I predated it one day before, so I always feel like I have missed the deadline. When that happens, I go into a state of panic and start doing what must be done. I also put arbitrary deadlines on myself. It helps me challenge myself to become better. It also helps me to complete tasks a lot of the time. Today, because I had predated this to one day before if I had not done this, I would have a backlog of 2 days of blogs, not just one. And one may be acceptable for me, but two? That is absolutely unacceptable. This is similar to cleaning your room. If you have no one coming over, it is going to take forever to clean. But if you have somebody coming over. Moreover, somebody you want to impress or, at the very least, have the best impression of you; your room will be cleaned in a matter of minutes rather than hours. We can always debate about the quality of the cleanliness, but our objective i.e. to be clean will have been reached. In the same way, if you were to engage yourself in creating arbitrary deadlines for yourself based on how you react to situations, you would be able to do what must be done. On New Year’s Eve, you will wake up at 11 just so that you can complete a blog that is unkempt, unpolished, and probably won’t be read by more than 10 people in its existence. But, hey, if it works, why should one not do it? Go out there, create arbitrary deadlines and get stuff done. Life is all about getting things done. Either by hook or by crook.

I will find one of these days when I will pre-date my blogs to one day after. In those days, I will write as if I am writing the blogs for the next day rather than the present one. I remember the teacher made us write a page to improve our handwriting in class 5. I remember the teacher, the class, the students, the bench I used to sit on, and how I was as a kid. Rather troublesome I would say now that I think about it. So, this Nepali teacher wanted us to write a page per day. In doing so, what happened was I was bored of writing just one page, so I started writing a couple more pages when I was bored. By the end of the week, I had finished the copy. So, every time he checked my copy, he would find that I was a diligent student who always did his homework. He was a teacher who cared because he asked me, “Bipin, you write every day, yet, why is your handwriting still shit?” I didn’t know how to tell it to him. One day, he folded my copy back to give it to me. There, he noticed that I had already filled the next page. Then he started turning the page, and I wanted to turn away and run. That was an emotion that I have not yet seen to this day. On his face, you could see he was both disappointed and impressed at what I did. He then ticked and marked all the pages. Then, from tomorrow, I had to do the work again, and instead of doing it, I just got scolded for not doing my homework.

In school, I never did my homework. I just had a couple of pages for all of my subjects. I remember standing outside of my class because I did not submit the homework for Nepali twice with the same excuse. Some subjects had proper copies, but most did not have copies at all. I still sometimes wonder how I pass my school. I don’t even remember what I used to write in Exams. I was just there to have fun or just go there because it was asked of me. Even when I think back on it now, I didn’t want to be in that place with those people. I used to daydream most of the time. I used to think of stories and never even concentrated in class. How the hell did I always end up in the top 10 or top 4 without trying? I will never know. I remember everyone used to say that if I tried a little bit more, I would become great. But, as far as I remember, I don’t think I ever tried to do more.

My father used to say, “Become first, I will buy you a PC”. And I desperately wanted a PC. But, why was my desire to want a computer not great for me to study more and try to become the top of my class? I thought that would be a great motivator for me to study. But, alas, it never did. Fast forward to grade 10, I topped my school with a percentage of 87.75%. The only time I came first in life. This was not because of my desire to become first, gain something from my parents, or just any other motive. This was solely because I taught a guy who was scared of asking the teachers for help. I had to teach him. Slowly, he went from barely passing to passing, then slowly 60%, 70, and almost 80. After reaching 80, he started challenging me. Directly and indirectly. In doing so, he challenged me to study more, and as a result, I accidentally topped my class. It was never my intention to do so. It just happened.

I don’t intend to win. It just happens automatically when the stars align. I wonder when the stars will align next time. Or do I wonder if it has already?
