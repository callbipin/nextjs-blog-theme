# I will leave a light on

12th January

“Just because someone loses their way doesn’t mean they are lost forever.” - Charles Xavier.

In JP’s book, one of the rules of life is to look and act with yourself as if you are someone you are responsible for taking care of. I do tend to mother people around. I tell them to sleep on time, exercise, and have a better life. If I am doing that to everyone else, the first person I should start with is myself. We often fail to recognize ourselves as people. We will just ignore all that we are feeling for the sake of the people around us. At times, that may be a good thing. But, more often than not, it’s a terrible idea. You can’t save the world if you can’t save yourself. It all begins with you. If you don’t take good care of yourself, you are unable to take care of others. Yes, at the moment, it may seem like you are able to do more for others, carry their burdens, and temporarily ease their pain. But, in the long run, if you are not a person who has taken care of oneself enough to handle the burden of others, enough to not feel like you are owed the same hospitality from others, and enough of a person yourself, you will be in a grave deal of pain.

This is one of the things I realized after buying myself expensive things like my computer, an iPhone, my Apple watch, and my DJI Action 5. I have been moving through life without rewarding myself with the things I deemed I desired. As a kid, I was someone who actively went out of his way to suppress his needs. I didn’t want to be a burden on the family. I wanted to be the one who was able to provide for the family. To an extent, I still carry that burden. I still think if I was able to get a high paying job, I would have been able to make my Dad retire as he is almost approaching 60 and makes half the salary that I do. I would be able to buy a car so that he can comfortably go wherever he wants. I would be able to support him in conducting the wedding of my sister fully without any need to save money for multiple months. In doing so, I fail to understand what are the things I truly desire. Yes, to others, I can see that the things I bought wouldn’t make sense. The computer was unnecessary as I should not be playing games in this day and age. I have a Mac provided by the company, and I can use it for whatever I want. I also had an old, run-down PC from 2017 that could run Linux if I really wanted something personal of my own. For the mobile phone, I had a fully functioning mobile phone that worked. Even if I wanted to make videos, I had already bought a DJI Action 5. Even if I needed a good smartphone to render the videos, I could have bought an S24 ultra, which would have cost me 50k less. Then we have the Apple watch and DJI Action 5, which makes no sense for me to buy.

But emotions are seldom logical. I don’t know the rationale behind it, but I guess I was gifting the inner child in me. After buying all of those things, I feel really good. I see those reels of people posting their childhood photos asking, “Did we become rich in the future?” and they tell the story of if they did become rich or not and why. To me, I do not know why but that inner child within me is exuberant. People said it would be just for a week until you forget about all of it, but it’s been a month, and I still feel the same. I have a smile that has been plastered on my face. Even as I write this, I look around my room, and I do not feel like I come from scarcity. Growing up, I always felt like I had to preserve everything. As if the world didn’t have much to give. Now, I feel it’s the opposite. I feel the world is vast, and there is much to give to me and to everyone else who wills it.

If you have lost your way and you don’t find what you are looking for, it may not be solved using the same method that I used. Materialistic goods shouldn’t be the way to solve your problems. But, for me, it was a way to solve a problem that I did have. For me to see the world in a better light. For you, it may not be the same. You could be like the evil villain from Puss in Boots, Jack Horner (I don’t know if I wrote this correctly). If you don’t know, he becomes a villain, killing friends and foes alike. When asked why did he do so? If he had any childhood trauma that led to him becoming this way? The answer was just that he had everything in the world, yet he still turned out this way. A loving family, a wealthy business for him to inherit, and everything he could ever wish for. I really don’t know how it was such a good movie despite having such a shallow villain. But, fingers crossed, your problems can be solved by materialistic goods or something else, and you are not a psychopath.

I have lost my way. I do need to find it again. The inner child in me is happy for now. But, I have neglected what I desire and have failed to exert myself in the world. I have been living for the people around me and not the person within myself. I need to start. And it all begins with anger.
