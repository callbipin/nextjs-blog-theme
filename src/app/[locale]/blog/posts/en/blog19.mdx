# Wrath is not the answer

13th January

For a long time, I didn’t like being angry. But on the same hand, I never found angry people to unappealing. I like people who get angry easily. People who swear a lot. People who make mountain out of molehills for no reason. Just so that they can argue, be a nuisance, and change the entire atmosphere of the place. I don’t mean downright angry cursing at everything and everyone with no rhyme or reason. Just a person who is always in a mood to fight, to be difficult, to be able to charge right in with no cause or forethought of the outcome. This is something I absolutely love. I have been trying to be a little bit more angry for a few days now. And for some reason it has ignited a fire in me that I had not observed before. I was as if I was more than a person I used to be. A person that had a fire within himself and was able to light the world for the better or set it ablaze.

They say people should not be angry. Anger isn’t good for your health. To be honest, I do not think I have experimented enough with anger to know what is the way to harness anger. The resonance of an angry person of the world is very much different than the frequency I send out to the world. I am rather lethargic, don’t give off big pp energy, despite my body size, facial hair and shape, I neither look timid or someone that you would be afraid to pick a fight with. I am just someone who is a softie. But, if I were to take on anger, how would I be as a person. They say people who are quick to anger have high blood pressure. It is in the literal sense, having their blood boiled. I know you pedantic nerds are saying, pressure is about the movement of blood through the blood vessels and blood boiling is about the increase in temperature of the blood. Yes, I know those are two different things. But, in your body, if you have high blood pressure, your body temperature also goes high. I think. Now that I think about it, I don’t think that’s how it works. But, it would make sense for the blood to be warmer because specially when I am running fast, my heart beats fast, and I start sweating because my body is very warm.

Anywho, let’s get back to the matter at hand. Why should I get angry? To add on to this, what should I get angry about? People have different ways of doing things in life. A lot of people tend to become disciplined because this is the kind of person I am therefore, I am going to do this. There are others who are very judgemental and think, this is not the way it should be, so I will do it the way it should be. Because this is the correct way of doing things. I am doing it this way. Then there are these people who are just angry god knows what for and they just do stuff. They are not someone who is having a bad day. They just walk around with wrath with them on their shoulders. They are incapable of being in touch with their emotions, so they just explode with a lot of wrath everywhere. Despite what other people may assume, these kind of people get things done. I have tried the method of saying, “This is not okay. I need to do things in a particular manner.” I have tried and tried but at the end of it all, all I am thinking is, “I do not care enough for it to be okay.” I know I just give up. I don’t care enough to consider something as not okay. After a while, even if the socks are on the floor and not in their designated area, I will just be like, it’s not the end of the world, I will live. This brings me to the other way in which people are disciplined.

I think therefore I am. A correct interpretation is I am this, therefore I must do this. I am a singer and therefore I must sing everyday. I tried this method. I have been trying to delude myself that I am a writer and therefore I must write every single day. It worked for a while but it didn’t after that. I said I am an artist and therefore I must develop ways to develop my art. Yet, I was unable to do what was needed to be done. I can’t identify with such a person. I have a very hard time relating to the people around me. Even in fiction. I can’t find people who are like me. When I say, I am this or I am that, I have never seen a version of myself that has become that specific thing. I guess George R. R. Martin is there but he is a lazy bum who will probably die before writing the last book. To get back to the matter at hand, I am not able to identify myself as a specific type of person thus being that said person I must do specific tasks.

Therefore, we use the next weapon in our arsenal. We use wrath. Just be angry at everything. Be angry at the fact that you have not written things. Be angry at the fact that you have not practiced. Be angry that you wasted the day playing games or doom-scrolling on the internet. What does that do? It causes my inner mediator to say, “Let’s not be angry, let’s try to resolve things.” I do not like conflict. So, what must be done in order to resolve the conflict? Write 3000 words because I have been a lazy bum who has not written for 3 days. And surprisingly, it works.
