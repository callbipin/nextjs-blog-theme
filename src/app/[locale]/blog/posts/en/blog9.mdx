# To ChatGPT or not to Chatgpt

3rd January

I just realised that I can turn my Mac resolution into a 2k screen. This means that I have more real estate when writing. Whohoo, I am so excited.

Let us start! The first thing I do is I turn off Grammarly. I know it wants the best for me. But for this exercise, we don’t want the best for me. We want me to be rattled, thinking, pondering, being wistful, deep in thought about what I am going to write next. What will be the next sentence that will flow out of me? This is not an active pursuit of writing. This is a pursuit of figuring out all the ideas within me. If I am able to give on giving out to the world what I have within me. The ideas, the thoughts, the limericks, and the gimmicks. This is a test. A challenge. An exercise of my mind. To see how I can make patterns in my mind. I know I am stalling, but all I am doing is trying to figure out what to say next. What next to do? To be brutally honest, I do not have anything right now. I just cleaned my room and took a shower. I can feel the sun on my bare back and my nipples reflecting in the glaring screen on my laptop. But, I do not feel words flow out of me. I am just pondering how can I make myself to that. Is today the day? The ninth day of the 1000 words a day. The day I am out of ideas to know what to write next. I have exhausted my vocabulary and have nothing more to offer. Is this the end of what becomes of this blog series? A mere nine days of trying and nothing to gain. To reach a point where I can talk of nothing more but just flounder around the very idea of writing 1000 words a day. To reach the peak of creativity and deliberate work. I am nothing now. I have given all of myself, and there is nothing more of me to give. This is the end. This is where we shall lay down our pen and move on to bigger things in life. Not engage in meaningless pursuits that don’t yield to anything. No more meaningless writing that has no purpose other than to serve one’s own vanity. From today onwards, there shall be no more of this tomfoolery. No more gibberish word vomit that starts off in the Milky Way but ends off in the piss-ridden alleys of Calcutta. Today, we shall move on from this cornucopia of rambles towards meaning, structure, and value. Today, we move forward. Today, we move forward.

Death is the beginning, not the end. I can not be out of words. Out of ideas. Out of expression of thought. I have lived a life filled with varied experiences each of them providing me a unique viewpoint based on my judgements of the events. This puts me in a unique position to express a viewpoint that no one else has ever offered. I think a lot of people are scared of writing now because we have ChatGPT and it does all the writing for us. When I was talking to a loquacious friend about ChatGPT, he said he was very reserved about the idea of AI. I realised that much of the value he provides to society is similar to what ChatGPT can do but to a lesser extent. He is able to give people ideas, opinions, and advice on how to live life. He is a man of philosophy and verbosity. This made perfect sense to me as to why he felt that his position in society was threatened. We are creating a being, and there is no doubt about it that we will make it either in 5 years or the next 50, that will threaten what value people bring to society. If we don’t add value to society, and we are working on the premise that we survived in society by providing specific values, we will see this as threatening the whole fabric of human existence. We humans are very social creatures. Simply, the mobile phone and ubiquitous connection created by the internet have changed the way we live, communicate, and express ourselves. Imagine how all the dynamics that we have will change when we have a new player in our society. One that is able to provide much more value than all of the members combined. For today, AI is a tool. In the generations to come, we will see AI not simply as a tool but as a member of society.

AI has made its entrance at a very funny time in the human timeline. We are not at the place yet where we are able to make technological advancements to conquer space. We also are not at a technological place where AI can’t be utilised. We are at the perfect place where AI can either make the world a utopia or a dystopia. We have the technology to save the world, make sure there is no injustice in the world, feed every poor soul, and have the best quality of life for people. We are also at that place where we can turn the world into a dystopia. The wealth, power, and influence of the world is concentrated in a small group of people. We can easily see how narratives are set by people who are at the top. There is a little bit of democratisation of information due to the competition of various mediums. But, at the core of it, we can still see information being influenced. The world that comes ahead fills me with excitement and dread. With hope and despair. For the road to hell is paved with good intentions. For we live in the best of times in human history, and it can only get better than this. Our problems in the future will be much more simple and complex than the ones we have today. But we will still have problems. To rephrase the thing a nurse told me, just because I broke a finger doesn’t mean you should compare it with someone whose whole body is in a cast. Both of them are hurting. Your finger and the person in the cast. You are allowed to feel the pain regardless of other people's suffering. No matter if your problem is big or small in comparison. It is a problem for you.

Sadly, humans tend to find problems in their lives no matter how good they are. Maybe a day will come when we are grateful.
