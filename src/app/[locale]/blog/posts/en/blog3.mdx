# The Oath that binds us

28th December

I am listening to some guy sing on Discord. Another tab plays a video about “What videos have been deleted on YouTube?”. I dunno what my mind is seeking. I do know this is not correct. But I want to understand why I am addicted to this stimulus. I can’t think properly when I have all this noise. But there is a switch in my brain. If I want, I can make them background noise and just keep on writing. What am I doing when I am doing this, though? Is it that I require more noise to push myself to do more? If I want, can I write this whole thing with the music and the guy talking at two times the speed in the background? Is this what ADHD is? Being aware and unaware at the same time.

No, I bloody can not do it. I try my best to think I am ADHD, but at the core of it, my problem is straightforward in nature. Simply, I do not do the thing that must be done. There are no negotiables in my life. I have no oath I am loyal to, no saying or speech, no sermon or no quote from the holy book that binds me. That’s the problem with not being bound by anything. I am neither free nor am I chained. People often believe not being chained means that you are free. But if you are also not bound to anything, what are you? This is a weird concept to grasp, but being free means knowing what you are and who you are. If you don’t know that, how are you free? Freedom means you have what you desire, you know who you are, and you are capable of exercising your freedom.

An oath binds you but sets you free. I never understood this, to be honest. I just know that if you are able to give yourself to an oath, a principle, a dogma, the rest of the world fades away, and you are able to roam around the boundary that is set forth by your chosen poison. This has been something I am aiming to reach, but every time I find something, I am able to reason myself out of it. I am either lazy or too moody to follow through with a dogma. I am always chasing something new rather than settling for what I have and chasing for what I need. Just look at me right now. It’s almost 12 and instead of sleeping what am I doing? I am writing this. Well, this is not the bad part but you know what is the bad part? I am listening to some guy singing some song on discord while doing so. Why can’t I just give priority to this simple task with the attention it deserves?

I know I can just disconnect and concentrate just here. It would not be the end of the world. Nobody would mind. In fact, nobody would care. But, what am I doing here? I have observed this various times throughout my life. I have just been staring and immobile when I should just be moving to do the right thing. It’s not even me bargaining, arguing , or weighing the ideas. I have a clear idea of what is right and what is wrong. Yet, my body fails to move. I know I should just move that plate to the kitchen. I know I should just move and start with my assignment. I know I should just go sleep. But, I don’t do what is right for me. I don’t do what is needed for me. Out of me. From me. This has been bugging me about what or who is it that is controlling my body. For the dissonance of who I am with my actions has been causing me quite some pain.

The guy playing the guitar is playing different chords to know what was the chord that came after a specific series of chords. I have found myself trying to find the keys myself when I learnt game of thrones theme music. I have been searching for the keys that sound the way I want it to sound. Is it that simple to learn music? So, all I need to do is keep on playing and then I will get a sense of which note to hit and which note I want to hear and match them. This should not be this easy. But, what if it is? If it is that easy that means I should have just been practicing daily. If I had started in the year 2022, it would have 3 years that I played the piano. But, alas, I have not done that. I have not even practiced today. This means I am again on day one. Without practice, without knowledge, without experience.

I feel like I have only grown in weight for the past 2-3 years. This makes me really sad. I don’t think I have learnt enough concepts, nor have I delved into a topic deep enough for me to be considered a professional in the subject. Have I been wasting away? I am happier but is happiness what pushes me forward? I have not had the desire or need because of the money I earn. I do not feel like it’s the end of the world or my life. I just feel calm and at peace. Maybe I should introduce a bit of conflict in my life in terms of who I am and what I am right now. I can only be more of myself if I challenge myself to be more. I need to introduce conflict for myself. I need to be the one who pushes myself to change.

This is the way to go. The only way to go. There is no going back.
