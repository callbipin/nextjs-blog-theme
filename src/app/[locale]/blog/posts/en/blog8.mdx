# I got my apple watch

2nd January

I got my apple watch yesterday and I have been using it to track my life. I don’t use it for much right now. Mostly for exercise. There is a ring there that tracks how much I have moved, how much exercise I have done and lastly, how much I have stood up. I do not understand the need for counting how much time I have stood up but it’s there and I am not complaining. I like how it tracks my exercise though. At certain times of the day whenever I do something that causes my heartbeat to be faster than a certain threshold, it considers it to be exercise. That’s pretty neat. In order to increase this, I have now started jumping rope or pretend to jump rope in my room. I do not have a big enough room that I could use the rope without knocking off a lot of things in my room. So, for now, I just pretend that I am jumping rope and do the same arm movement as I would while jumping rope. This is a great start for me. For I can do HIIT exercises without trying. There is not much variety in this but I need to start somewhere. I won’t try to do much either. I will just try to fill up the 30 minutes that is present there. What previously used to happen was because I knew a myriad of exercises each specialized for a specific thing, I used to try to do all of them when I did exercise and when I stopped I didn’t do anything at all. So, for now, I will just do jump rope for a certain amount of time before I move on to try to do other sorts of exercises. I do feel a little bit of tinge on my lower back after jumping rope. So, I should also supplement my jumping rope sessions with a little bit of light back strengthening exercises. I know what to do for now. This is what I will stick with for the next 7 days.

This week will be the first week of the new year. I have been trying to journal, exercise a bit, learn the piano a bit throughout the week. It has been going good for now. I thought I would maybe not be able to do it today because I still had a lot of things left to do. I still had fifteen minutes of exercise to do, I had not touched the piano yet, I needed to complete my assignment which I should have completed ages ago. Yet, when I started just working out, the pieces just fell into the right places. The picture was complete before I knew it. My room is a little bit cleaner so I won’t have the excuse of , “Oh, I have to clean my room” tomorrow morning. I can simply just tidy up the small bits and pieces. Maybe vaccum a little bit and sweep a little bit. Other than that, my room is clean now. On the other hand, I sang and then did my cardio. I was able to reach 30 minutes. I know if I try a little bit, I will be able to reach 35. But, I won’t push it for now. In my previous endeavours, I was always all or nothing. This time, I am creating a balance where it is either 30 minutes or trying to reach 30 minutes. I know, I know. Cardio alone isn’t enough. I agree. But, I am not at the point where I can strength train properly. I need to rebuild myself up with cardio then I can move on to strength training. Besides, jumping rope is a strength training exercise for my feet. For my upper body, I will do sandbags carry or rice bags carry from next week. An interesting fact about rice bag carrys. Previously, I was not able to easily pick up the 25kg rice bag. But now, I was surprised at how light it felt. I will continue to do that training after this week. But, for now, I am satisfied with what I am capable of doing. I digress. Now, on to my journaling.

My journaling has been going decent for now. I realised what helped me the most was my 2k monitor. No, and it’s not because of what you think. You see people don’t normally see text in terms of how many words written. We can’t easily count what is the amount of text that is present in a paragraph. We rely on the perceived volume of the paragraph to determine if a paragraph has a lot or little text. In my laptop monitor, the texts are bigger and more compact. So, I reach the end of the line quickly. The paragraphs too look full and voluptuous without me writing much. The page is simply easily filled within a few sentences of my writing. But, here comes my secret weapon. My 27 inch 2k monitor shows the letters in crisp details but it is spread out over a wide area. Even to reach this third paragraph I am only one third way from the top of the monitor. I still have two thirds of the monitor to write just to fill this page. This is a visual trick. But, it gets the job done for me. It makes me feel like I am not writing a lot nor am I writing long sentences. As the sentences never seem to fully cover a line. It just makes me feel like I am writing small paragraphs. And before I know it, I will have written a lot. I know I am a very verbose person when it comes to writing. But, I don’t want to see big chunks of text covering the entire screen. I would rather prefer to see small paragraphs. But, in order for me to change paragraphs I have to talk about different ideas and not the same one. But, more often than not, I like delving deep into a specific topic when I am writing. I know I can digress pretty easily. I don’t want to do that. I want to follow the pattern of thought that I was following and reach its conclusion to its sweet or bitter end. Therefore, I love this setup for writing. I know this makes me feel a little bit unsatisfied. As I observe what I have written I can see that I have merely written three paragraphs, which in my perception should not even reach five hundred words much less a thousand. But! Again with my but and then again! If I look at the word count, I have already crossed 1138 words as I write this. If I look at my monitor, I am not even halfway of the page. It is a visual delicacy that I absolutely love.
