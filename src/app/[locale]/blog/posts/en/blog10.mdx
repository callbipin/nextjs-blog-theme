# Why I write

4nd January

Why do I write?

Today, I am going to do something different. I am going to write with a title first and then I will try to narrow my thoughts into that subject matter. So, with the advancement of this exercise of writing 1000 words a day, we shall start with the addition of a title. I have had a lot of junk food today and I can see that my mental state isn’t in the place it is supposed to be at. Let’s see if that changes the way I write and the the things I talk about.

Today’s Title: Why do I write?

I have always been fond of expressing myself. Most of the time when I failed to understand something: an Idea, a topic, or any vague sentences that I was reading, it always helped when I spoke it out a lot. In a similar fashion, whenever I was in deep contemplation about not understanding myself, I choose to write it out. I really like the line from Hamilton that says, And when my prayers to God were met with indifference,I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance”. Writing has been similar to me in that sense. I have been writing my whole life. At first just for the sake of writing. Then it was writing assignments and homeworks. Then it was content writing and then technical. Now, I am writing again. And I don’t know why?

I did ask myself this question but I am really struggling to find an answer. I want to move forward in life. I have been stuck in stagnation and I am unable to achieve any of the goals I have set up for myself. I need to fully understand though why these goals and why do I want to achieve them.

I was talking to my girlfriend today and she also felt the same way I did when it came to office politics, and certain other real life events where people cared a lot more. Both of us are agreeable people who just give a little bit too much of ourselves to other people. This as a whole has turned us into conformists who have a hard time saying no explicitly or implicitly. To parents, to society, and to friends. This has caused us to be in jobs not because we want to be there or because we have any affinity towards it but simply because society said we should get a job. Or having a job helps with the few expenses that we have. We don’t have a cause for being part of the workforce. We just are there because it is expected of us. We are not people who believe in any cause that causes us to be at our job. We are there to just do the required and get the fuck out of there. We don’t care about the possibilities of the org or the team if we had a better payscale, or a better manager. Could things be better? Yes, obviously, it can always be better. But, if it’s horrible, do we care enough to actually try to change it? No! We don’t have the energy for it.

At the core principle level, there is only so much we want to do. We will point out what is wrong and me on the other hand will blatantly say what is wrong. But, do I expect things to change? Do I expect people to change? No! People have been the way they are for their entire lives. Sure, they may change a few things for a couple of days, but people go back to being their own horrible selves after a couple of days. True change is only possible in a few individuals. And for those individuals brutally telling them what is wrong works. They don’t need a speech, or exercises that they should do to learn leadership, empathy, see their own insecurities, be humble, have decency, or apologize when one is wrong. They will do these things by themselves. You don’t need to try hard with such people. People who are not this way. Hell may freeze over but they will never change the way they are. I don’t understand why other people fail to see it. Why do they still have hope?

So, what does writing do in all of this? Writing helps me flesh out what I am feeling. I don’t normally understand what it is that I feel. In fact, I almost never fully figure out what is it that I am feeling. I do know that there is a sprinkle of this emotion here and a dust of that emotion there. Even when I do understand what these emotions maybe, I do not know how to react to them. But, when I write it down, I have this inner clarity that what I feel is this. Like, when my cousin died, I felt all the pain in that emergency room. I was feeling the pain of my uncle who was hallucinating scenarios in which he could have saved her. I could feel the sadness of my uncle who broke down knowing that his daughter was no more. I know I should have never gone into that ICU. I remember seeing her when she had gained consciousness. She could only make small gestures. I felt the pain she felt knowing that her baby had died inside of her. Knowing that, I am sure, she didn’t have the will the live. She didn’t have a reason to live. I wonder if that’s the reason I have not thought about death. If I do not have strong beliefs about life, why would I have strong reasons to want to not want to continue with life? Just like with most of the things in my life, I simply don’t value it well enough. I would just do it to conform to an idea. Given that I am not emo, I would not have strong beliefs about death. I guess that makes me a goth. Goths think the world is fucked up. Emo thinks emo is fucked up. Emos are not keen on living. Goths are apathetic. I am apathetic. To the idea of life and death.
