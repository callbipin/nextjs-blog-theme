# The Purpose of Yapping

7th January

Yapping: An art, a distraction, and escape.

Many a times, I am forced to answer my question of what is the point of spilling all one has to offer? What is the point of saying intricate things, telling facts and figures, weaving stories of old and new, from the ages to spaces? What do we achieve by creating a web of truths and maybe even lies? I have been writing for about 13 days now. The number 13 might be unlucky for people, but if you look closely, it looks like the letter B. I have always had an affinity for the letter B from a very young age. I could feel unlucky about the number that represents my name. I certainly could not. Besides, 13 is an incredible number; how could it not be.

Today, we are talking about the thing I love to do the most. Yapping. I thought I wasn’t a yapper, but I was wrong. When I look back at grade 1, I remember my friends used to talk about Prithvi Raj Chohan. How the latest episode was the best. I, out of nowhere, said, “Yes, I also found the story amazing. It was so cool when the prince wielded his sword and vanquished his enemies.” All the monkey-looking rich brats in my school agreed. They also said they loved that episode of last night. Little did they know those rugrats, I didn’t have cable at my house. I made the whole story up. I just said that because I wanted to seem cool. They, on the other hand, didn’t want to feel like they didn’t get to watch that episode or missed something special, so they just agreed to the incredible story I created. No one had the gall to say I was wrong. Conformists! All of them.

Then, it leads me to my teachers and homework. For some lazy reason, I never did my homework. When I say never, I mean never. I remember all the kids rushing to the teacher to get their copies checked. I was the only one who used to sit in my seat and just be with myself. Obviously, this was not the best strategy. This is because the room would be divided into two halves. On the one side, there is me, sitting alone at my desk. On the other, there would be the teacher and all the rugrats surrounding the teacher like a moth to a flame. This made me stand out, and the teacher asked, “Bipin, where is your homework?” That’s how I got caught. So, the next time, when everyone swarmed the teacher, I went along with them with my copy. After a while, as the crowd simmered down, I returned to my seat with my copy. That way, I didn’t get caught. For a while, it worked. But, I already created a reputation in school as the kid who made a lot of noise and trouble. I didn’t mean to do that, but school was so boring. Even the things they taught at school. I remember playing a game where I imagined a small character that used to run over the letters of the sentences. Doing parkour, swinging off the ‘y’s and ‘g’s and making its way down the page. It was my favorite pastime. I didn’t want to do classwork or homework. I was just there. If I look back now, it was the worst waste of time anyone can ever do in their life. I am sure I was not learning anything. The things I know came secondhand hearing what the teachers said. I wasn’t used to top the class, but my rank would always be top 8 or top 4 without me even trying.

I do remember I was always the weird one out. I never, for the life of me, studied or had proper copies. I had one rough copy, and you’d find work on a new subject every quarter. Basically, it was easy for me to use one copy and use it for 4 subjects. For homework, I still can’t figure out what I did. In grade 1, they called my sister cause my mum did my homework. They did this again in grade 2 and grade 3. I don’t think much has changed. I still hadn’t done my homework but came in the top 8. By grades 6 and 7, my friend collected copies to be graded. He used to grab our two copies and start collecting everyone else’s. Ultimately, he would just make sure our copies were not submitted. I still remember the Nepali teacher being bloody pissed at me for not doing my homework for 3 weeks, after which she finally made me stand outside the classroom because she thought I was not worthy of being in the class. I still never did her homework.

I only remember doing homework for mathematics. It wasn’t homework per se. It was just us 3 nerds competing about who would complete the exercises quickly in mathematics. We used to solve questions just because we could. The teacher would be ticking different questions to do; we’d have finished all of them by skipping steps because factorization doesn’t require 5 steps; it could have been done in 2. I think Binita Mam didn’t mind it. I do remember her beating the shit out of me because I mocked her when she was scolding another student. She also changed our seats. We were the three nerds sitting on the first bench. We made so much noise because we played paper cricket that she had to separate us for a peaceful classroom. We were not going to listen to what she would be teaching cause, obviously, she would be teaching exercise 8.1, and we’d be discussing exercise 9.3. Then, our discussion would just be noise for the class.

I only studied properly after coming to The NAMSS in grade 9. The change in college brought about a new me. But that’s another story for another day.
