# Cleaning my room

27th December

I should clean my room. I have been trying for quite some years now, but for unknown reasons, it becomes messy again as soon as I clean it. My room isn’t dirty—it’s just messy. I know, I know. I should have a system. A perfect place for everything. That way, I don’t have to worry about where the charger should be or where this or that should be. I should be doing that. But I have not been doing that, just like the many things I should have been doing for the last many years.

2025 is here, and I think I am filled with regrets. I wanted to do a lot of things in life. Some were a moment of passion, and others were because I wanted to be that specific type of person. Looking at how I wasted my day yesterday, I am filled with the deep, profound realisation that I am already at that stage where I am supposed to be the person I used to think about when I was younger. I am almost 27 now. It will be here in 6 months. This scares me. I am merely a shell of the person I want to be.

Well, what is it that I want to be? Firstly, someone who plays the piano well. I don’t want to be like the Asian kid who plays in opera theatres, but I want to be someone who plays more than just a couple of songs (i.e. Game of Thrones and Bella Ciao). Now, I have the resources to play, yet I keep procrastinating on practising or trying out something new. I want to be able to create some kind of melody with that instrument that keeps staring into my soul, but I have not been able to bring myself to practice every single day.

Another thing I want to be is fit. I do wish to have visible six-pack abs, but more so than that, I don’t want to be fat anymore. I want to be big but not necessarily have this belly that protrudes more than smartphone cameras nowadays. Bear in mind, I don’t want to look like a body builder but simply as someone who is able to move quick and not get out of breath while walking three flights of stairs. Also, I want to be able to go on treks without feeling like I am going to die after taking a simple step.

Those are the things I want personally. In my personal life, I want to be better at the paino and have a fitter body than the one I currently have. But what of my professional life? I never thought I was someone who wanted to be in the professional field. I always thought money would find its way to me. To a certain extent it has. I have never vehemently chased after money or any sort of position in life. But, maybe, the time has come where I actively pursue the art of creating value so that people compensate me for the created value. I know I am able to create value out of thin air like I create ideas and random sentences out of thin air. This is chaos and it may not be of value to people. But, value is the refinement of chaos in a palatable manner that espouses in people the idea of becoming more than what they were previously. That is a wound up sentence but the essence is the creation of ideas that would for a while inform, or entertain the viewers of my content.

There is something holding me back from creating content though. Is it the idea that I am an INTP and my journey is to become an ESFJ. It could be. But, I can never become it. I can never be as successful as other ESFJ/INFJ creators I know. Or is it because I had this one INFJ with whom I went back and forth about content creation and he replied, “You think you can make better videos?”. At the time, I replied, “Youtube isn’t about creating better videos, just different.” This shook him a bit. I did genuinely mean it at the time. Youtube or content creation in general is about being different. You do not like someone because they are similar to other creators that you watch, consume, and embody. You do so because they bring something new to the table.

This begs the question, “What is something different that I want to bring to the table?” Whenever I talk to people about public speaking or endeavour to talk about any topic, I am quietly reminded by myself through my own speech of my values. I am always grandiose in my explanation of ideas, my ideals, my message to the world. I am always the proponent of being bigger than yourself and when doing so people claim I have a larger than life persona. In my deepest desire, I do wish to be larger than life. I am a visionary that sees vision of the future. Of what can be. This world. The people around me. We can be so much more than we currently are. This is merely because we are choosing not to be more.

What is this desire though? To be more than who we are. The idea of being larger than life? I often imagine myself as the protagonist that’s changing the world, that’s diving into the trenches of battle and slaying evil to rid the world of darkness and bring out a new light. I wondered is it because scrawny INTPs like myself good story tellers because we don’t do that thing in the real world? We observe the heros that are present and think to ourselves, this is the way he could have become a better hero. I am always perplexed by such writers. I can see George R R Martin wrote the story about Ice and Fire. Yet he is warm snow. I talk about grandiosity, genocide of evil, AI taking over to make this world a better place, and when you look at me, I look like a thrift shop Santa. So, how does this battle between the grandiosity (or narcissism) of thought and the reality that exists outside come into fruition?

INTPs are normally wizards that guide others on their journey. But, in order be the one who guides Frodo to his journey, shouldn’t we also experience adventure, growth, and sense of heroism. How can you become the guide to others, if you are someone who has not inherited the will through your actions. This has been a big quandary of mine. I am very much satisfied with knowledge. So much so many a times knowing is enough for me. I do not chase the journey or the feeling that comes afterwards. Should I dive in regardless of knowing. Regardless of having that feeling that this is enough. I do not know.
