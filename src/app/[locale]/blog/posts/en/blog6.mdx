# The Beginning 2025

31th December

Alright, another day, another writing. Today, we start with some rather dandy. I am so happy. I can’t for the life of me understand why I am happy, but I have been full of butterflies and berries throughout the day. Today is nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing new has happened, nor has anything from my past spurred up to come to haunt me. Today is one of those days. A tinge of happiness sprinkled with giddy all over. It’s a good day.

Now, let’s move on to more pressing matters at hand. The start of 2025. It’s a new era. For some reason, years ending in 0 or 5 seem to have a strong connection to them. It may be me just being superstitious, but there exists some kind of power in them. They are able to change individuals in ways people have never thought about till now. The question that remains in my head is, “Will this year be the year I will be able to change?” I have changed quite a bit in the past few or five years. I do not know if for the better though. Talking to my colleague who used to know me from college he said I was a different person back then. I am a different person now. Obviously, people change. That is not up for debate. But, he spoke about a me that I do not see myself in the past. He said I seemed more focused, cunning, and strategic in the past. As if I walked around with a specific goal in my mind. I was always present and seemed to have a hunger that I do not have anymore. The only hunger I have now is for stuffing my face with unhealthy food. I have only grown in the ability to gobble up copious amount of unhealthy food. There is always a fondness of people to look back at history with joy and forgetting what actually existed. The golden age fallacy I believe. I may be wrong. Just remembering about the good old days. This sounds like something he may be dreaming up of as well. He thinks, because I have turned into this docile panda, I used to be a person more than I am right now. I used to someone tactical, megalomaniacal, and most important of all, not round.

This has been itching my brain for a while now. We humans have specific personalities but we can to the extent of our desires become whomever we choose to be. If I were to choose to be that person, would that be achievable. Would I be able to become the person that he saw in me or remembers me as from the golden age? Is it possible for a person to completely abandon who they are to become someone else completely? Can a person be more than what they are predestined to become? These are the questions that are rattling my brain. If I were to understand the traits of what makes a specific type of person, then I carry out to act accordingly to that manner, would I actually become it.

I know, I know. You might be wondering, but Bipin! Why would you want to be someone else? To answer that question quite blithely, to become the person I want to be. I remember reading the Prince when I was a young boy who didn’t understand most of the words that it contained. I am pretty sure I misinterpreted a lot of words that were said there. I remember watching the video analysis because I could not for the love of me tiny pee brain understand many of the concepts written there. In that video, it talked about how the Prince needs to be the person at the top. The person who everyone will listen to. You can have all the good morals, ideas, and intentions in the world. But, that is of no use if you are not someone who is in a position of power. The only people who are granted the opportunity to expand their will on the world are the people with power. First you must fight tooth and nail to try to reach the top. You must forsake your own principles because that is what it takes to be the one who is above all. After you are done and you have claimed victory to that god awful throne at the top, then, and only then, will you be able to impart your will upon the world. It’s very easy to be righteous when looking from the bottom. But, when one is at the top of the throne, that is when it matters to become righteous. That is when it matters to throw your wisdom, your limericks, and rhymes. If you are someone sulking at the bottom making cowardeous excuse about the people at the top, guess what Buckeroo, no one cares.

The question I ask myself is, “Do I want people to care?” I firmly believe I am not emotionally mature to understand if I care or not. But, given the predicament I am in and the myriad of emotions I feel throughout my days and throughout my life, I can feel a calling deep within me. I can tell that I am unsatisfied by the way I am living my life. In terms of who I am and who I want to become. I know there is a part of me deep inside that is deeply sad because I have not become what I wanted to. I have let myself down. This is a recent revelation that has dawned on me. I used to feel like death is the only salvation for me. I didn’t just joke around but I felt it in my bones. I do not know what has happened but that flip has switched. I do not care for death anymore. She is waiting for me, I know. When my time comes, she is going to wrap me in her embrace and breathe into me to take me to meet Styx. Nowadays, I do not know what has come over me, but I have started my appreciation of life.

Is it wonderful? I have people around me that care for me. I have love, a loving healthy family, friends, a roof over my head, a relatively stable job, and a little bit of money for a rainy day. I have everything I want and more. From tomorrow, I also have a plan of attack for 2025.
