# Am I not doing enough

10th January

Am I not doing enough?

I have always had this on the back of my mind. What kind of person would I be if I had done more than what I am currently doing? Am I doing the best to my abilities. But, this again made me question the entire premise itself. The way people talk about potential and what a person is capable of doing. I always thought of potential in terms of Work = mgh i.e. mass times acceleration due to gravity and heght. This is the formula for potential energy. Energy can neither be created nor destoryed. So, the energy is within all of us. We all have potential. But, what happens is that energy is only useful when that potential energy turns into Kinetic energy. Similarly, when we talk about a person having a potential to do more in life, that only becomes true when that potential energy is converted into Kinetic energy. So, regardless of whom the person may be, the potential energy as humans is the same for all of us. Yes, there may be some people for whom mathematics may be easier or for others who can write beautiful pieces of work or throw a ball really far. But, if you take the general population, then any person is capable of being more than oneself. They have the potential to become any kind of person. The activation energy to start that conversion and the conversion rate may be slower in other individuals but it is possible nonetheless. There are a lot of variables at play that help or impede this process but at the crux of it, this is the matter.

On the other hand, if I didn’t do things that are according to my skill level, doesn’t that also imply that I do not have the skill to implement all that I am capable of in an effective manner. So, why is that not considered an important aspect when considering the potential of an individual. The potential of an individual to reach towards their potential is an important variable that we often neglect in our analysis of somebody’s potential. The potential of a person is defined by various metrics, namely: Intelligence, shrewdness, and the capacity to transform knowledge. But, in doing so, why do we always fail to consider the ability of a person to just do stuff. The best way to know what a person is capable of is to convert their potential energy into kinetic. So, that the energy can have a real world impact. If we are not able to calculate this then we fail to truly calculate a person’s potential. A person’s potential should always be measured by what he/she/they are able to accomplish in the world. The rate at which they are able to convert their potential energy into Kinetic energy.

This brings me back to my original question. Am I doing enough? The question is do I have the capacity to do more. A further analysis of the question is will I be the person who does more?

The answer is, I don’t know. I want to be that person but often times i find myself fraying away from the person I am meant to be. I look at the person that I see in the mirror and I barely recognise that person. It’s not because I have grown old or because I have gotten a little bit fat. It maybe a little of those things as well. But, at the core of it all, I never imagined what kind of an adult I’d become. I didn’t think five years into the future and think, “In five years time, I will be this cool adult.” I never had specific dreams of my own. I just used to pick which every dream sounded coolest and roll with it until I have another sweet career that I would like to orate to all that I would become. I never defined the person I wanted to be. The problem with not defining is that you are free to be whomever you want to be. But the answer is that you may not like the person that you have become. This will be something that will haunt you. You didn’t define yourself and now you are some person that you don’t even recognize. I always had ideas of what kind of person I would want to be. They were never set in stone but there was always a glimpse of it. Now, I feel like because I didn’t define what I didn’t want, I have those characteristics within me. I know I didn’t use to be a better person before. I don’t believe in the past being better than the current present. I do not believe in the golden age fallacy. In fact, I have something that is the opposite of golden age fallacy.

Whenever I think of the future, I am filled with joy and optimism. Knowing how horrible humans are, I am so surprised that I always have this view about the future that it will be great and full of roses and dandelions. I know I should be better for I know history is filled with horror and anguish and greed and sloth. Good people are never keen on taking up the mantle of responsibility and thus it falls on the hands of the treacherous cunning cunts. If history is any indication of the future, it will be a battle which represents the lust for power that humankind has. Humans, especially certain horrible humans, are capable of blowing the world over. But, we are at this pivotal point in time where we can change the pace of the world. We can have economies change. We don’t have to live in a world of meaningless job and scarcity of resources. We can create a world filled with abundance. The question now remains, will we reach there or not?
