# Nothing Stays the Same

1st January

Today, I was talking to a young lass, and I told him that the purpose of life is to be replaced by someone who is better than you. This shook him a wee bit. He always has had this idea of meritocracy. People who are good should be at the top. All fair to him; that is the way the world should work. If you are someone who is about to be operated on, you don’t want a doctor who got in because of quota. You have to trust in the doctor who won some medal for being the best. We should always reward people who do good in their fields. And at times, maybe even forgive them for the little ways in which they bend the rules.

Now, I don’t mean we let people get away with crimes just because they are rich. You see, Magnus Carlsen recently went to a chess tournament wearing jeans. Not skinny jeans that your Mum thinks she can still pull off, not the baggy jeans that the guys in your society wear as they expose their bum holes. These were just normal jeans. The ones you can wear and go into any church, government building, office or party. Yet, he was asked, could you go and please change? Now, this is not a woman wearing a skirt trying to enter the Supreme Court of Nepal. (I don’t mean it in a sexist way; I mean it in the why would they care about any person if they tried to enter. I have been denied entry to go pick up my Dad cause I was wearing quarter pants. That’s a stupid rule. But I digress). This is a living legend. A chess prodigy who was the Chess Champion for 10 years. To add icing to the cake, he didn’t lose the title. He just gave it away because that style of playing chess was boring for him. He didn’t want to defend his title anymore, so people just had a championship match without him to crown a champion without defeating Magnus. He is the absolute greatest of all time when it comes to chess. He was asked to either go and change or forfeit the match. And guess what he did? He forfeited the match.

Now, you might say, yes, that makes sense. Chess nerds are not seen as the best in the world. So, wearing formal pants would be better for the event. Yes, that may be true for everyone else. But Magnus? He is the show. He is the one who squeezes water out of stone. Turns impossible positions where people are thinking it’s a draw into places where he is winning and finally wins. Magnus is the one who brought chess mainstream. He is ferocious on the board. His antics are spread far and wide. He brings a lot of eyes to the table. This man! The man, the myth, the legend. The person who couldn’t reach 2900 elo is not because he is not good. But because there are no players on his level that can match him. He can play against others and win, but what he gets is +1 point in his elo. No one is good enough to be better than him to get him to 2900. This is the man in question. So, if he puts on jeans and wants to come to play late, as always, it should have been allowed.

I again digress. No one stays at the top forever. Or in a place of flat hierarchy or perceived flat hierarchy, no one should stay in the same place forever. You may have heard of the horrible manager paradox. People have horrible managers because they are individuals who cannot move higher on the ladder than those in that position. If you want someone to go higher than their current position, they need to become more than who they are. Work harder to break the shell of complacency that they are so used to and move up the ladder. But, this task is difficult, and complacency is warm and soft. Therefore, we have managers who can’t tell the people below them what they must do to rise up and become the best. Moreover, they don’t know what things are better to do or what can be more efficient ways to use the time of the employees. This creates a vicious cycle where they are neither innovative nor pushing towards the boundary of what’s capable, and they are not helping the people who work under them reach a higher state. They are just in the way.

Well, how do we tackle this? We need people to be replaced. Just like in basketball, it was Michael Jordan, then Kobe, then Lebron, and there would come a young spirit with vigour enough to eat the oldies of the past. In a company, too, the young people must replace the old people to burn the midnight oil. Their ideas may be good. They can be coaches. But the players need to be cycled and shuffled in a given amount of time. With young blood in the court, a business can do so much more. People, if left to their own vices, become complacent. There needs to be this feeling that you will be replaced. There needs to be a desire to not be complacent and reach higher than you currently are. There needs to be an understanding that the old will die and the young will take their place. This is the way of the world. Always have, always has been.

Today, I feel a bit more tired than I did yesterday. Is it because I worked out more? I don’t feel the energy to be able to do what I am supposed to do. Be able to write clearly. I see words flying on the screen, but are they there or simply just a figment of my imagination? I do not know. Hopefully, this exercise will help me understand as I grow deeper into the myriad labyrinths of my mind. I will either figure my way out or get lost in the nothingness inside of me.
