# Pursuit of Sausages

20th January

I have been, for quite some time now, trying to find a new job that pays me a little bit more. Not a lot, but just enough so that I could be able to tell my Dad,

"Here is my salary for this month, you can retire now.",

"Hey, I plan to put a down payment on that car so that you don’t have to endure the pollution or the cold wind on your knees anymore."

"Here is the money I have, now you can marry off Bidhya without any worries."

I don’t want a job that pays more because I would be able to buy the things I want. I don’t think there are things that I want that require more money than what I currently earn. I can have almost everything materialistic that I want with the money I make now. But, the things that my father wants. It’s a little bit different. And the thing I want is to be able to give what he wants.

When you are agreeable, you don’t know what you want in life, love, or your career. I, for a long time, didn’t understand my needs. I wanted things in life. Some for logical reasons, but mostly others for illogical reasons. I simply wanted them. May it be out of envy or desire, I wanted a lot of things when I was a kid. As I grew older and saw that my family didn't come from a place of abundance, I started to actively push down the feelings of need that I had so that I would not be a burden to the family. I wanted to be the sacrificial lamb that would give oneself up so that the other members of my family could eat. I say this metaphorically. Thankfully, we always had enough to eat. Well, except for my Dad. He actually bought some land in our village so that his parents could feed the remaining 6 children that were back home. I often joke about that with him. Saying if he had bought land here in Kathmandu instead of his village Nuwakot, he’d have fewer siblings, but we’d be a lot more richer. From his smile, I can tell that he appreciates the dark joke but is a very proud and fulfilled man who was able to feed his parents and six other siblings.

The more I think about life, the more I think about this idea of what matters more than money. My father may yap and whine a lot about us not having enough, and that I can’t leave my job until I find another one; In his heart of his hearts, he knows he is happier being the family man. He sometimes even feels a little down, thinking that he was not able to do more despite giving the world to me. I guess, for me, that is where my feelings come from. Not from my feelings within but reflecting his feelings. The desire to be the rock that everyone can count on. The oldest son who is able to buy land to feed everyone. The oldest son who will always make sure all 5 siblings get married (one decided not to get married. If he does decide one day, my Dad will be ready to help out). The one who was able to escape poverty. Come to the capital. Work his butt off during the day. Go to college in the evening. Come home late at night. Cook food. Some days, be so sleepy that you fall asleep before you eat the food because you do not have the energy anymore.

When I look at the life that he lived, from my empathetic point of view, it sounds like a hard life. By various measures, it was indeed. But did he do it all for money? Absolutely not. If he did, I’d have less uncles but a big ass mansion. Or he’d be in jail for corruption (Some people were caught recently buying government land for a cheap price 20-30 years ago. My Dad was offered the land, but he declined to buy it).

As a son, I feel like I have this responsibility to make sure he retires. Make sure he doesn’t have to continue suffering as he is becoming old and also very sick because he doesn’t take good care of his health. It’s not that he doesn’t take care of his health. It’s his diet that he doesn’t take care of. He seems to just not eat food properly and then has a habit of taking a lot of medicines related to gastrointestinal problems. Also, due to a lack of water, his kidneys also have a problem. He has a few other health issues that we shall not go into. But all of this can be solved with one simple thing. Me finding a job that pays me a little bit more than what it does right now. The pursuit of sausages.

I don’t like that my life has been dictated by this. I understand that there are kids working in coal mines who would love to swap their lives with mine. I know that I am in a lucky and grateful place where my body, besides a little bit of fat, is healthy and fully functioning. My parents are doing well and sleeping in the next room. My sister will still be a nuisance tomorrow. I have a job that pays relatively okay. I have a person whom I love, and she loves me. My life is in the best phase right now. I know I should not be a negative nelly. There are a lot of things that can be better, and there always will be. But! and there is always a but! I am conflicted by this pursuit of sausages. I do not understand my role in all of it. I play chess a lot. Maybe a little bit of an unhealthy amount. Despite that, I still am not really good. But, it has taught me that every piece has a purpose. And I am trying to find my purpose.

I feel like an anomaly that is just drifting without knowing where I belong and what I should be doing in life.
