# The Myth of Sisyphus

5th January

You all may know the story of King Sisyphus. He was so cunning that he was able to cheat dead. The Gods being the power hungry freaks that they were could not stand this. So, they cursed him. His curse was rather simple. He had to roll a boulder up a hill. When the boulder reached the top, it would roll down again. Then he would have to go to the bottom of the hill and then roll the boulder up the hill again. Quite a simple task. If you ask me, it seems much easier than what we do every single day. Just a task of moving something up a hill just to watch it come rolling down again. Quite useless.

Albert Camus said that one must imagine Sisyphus to be happy. I think Mr Albert forgot that he was a king who was able to cheat death. Imagine being a king who ruled over kingdoms. Who was one of the smartest people on Earth. He was not just able to live life to the fullest as a king but he was also smart enough to cheat death. Imagine being such a person and you’re given a monotonous task of rolling a boulder up a hill and having it roll down again just to have to roll it up the hill again. Yes, one must imagine Sisyphus to be happy. Which smart king would not love a life like that after cheating death.

I understand the interpretation Mr. Camus was going for. He wants to say that Sisyphus was happy because he had something to do. Now, for some bloody reason, there are a lot of these people out there. Who always have to do something. It’s almost as if they got something within them called enthusiasm or ambition. These little rug rats can’t stay bloody still. Always moving about. Always wanting to do something. When they do do something, they feel happy. May the task be as meaningless as rolling a boulder up a hill, they are happy. They simply can’t be happy just by doing nothing. For such people, Camus was right. These are Sisyphuses who are trying to roll a boulder up a hill, trying to cheat death, and wanting to be the king of their lives. They are happy despite knowing the boulder will roll down again.

For some reason, I am not one of these people. I remember fondly going to this motivational seminar when I was in grade 9. The school took students from grade 7,8,9, and 10. The motivational speaker asked, “How many circles, small or big, can you draw in 30 seconds? Write down your answer. I wrote down my answer. He then proceeded, “Has everyone written?” as his eyes scoured the room for an agreeable nod. We all said yes. Then he said, “In the next 30 seconds, try to draw as many circles as possible. Your time starts now.” Then in a frenzy, everyone started to draw circles on their copy. You could hear the room scrapping their pencils and pens on the paper. At the end of it, the motivational speaker asked, who has the most circles. Numbers were thrown around in the room until a little girl emerged victorious. She was called up on the stage. The speaker asked, “How many did you think you could draw?” She replied, 60. “And how many did you end up making?”, she said with a giggle, “140!”. That was quite impressive. She was able to create almost 2.3 circles per second. The speaker asked again, is there anyone who made less circles than the one they quoted. Everyone in the room went no with their nods. He proudly claimed, “See, how much we underestimate ourselves!”

How does this relate to Sisyphus? Well, the whole crowd was in awe of the motivational speaker. My friend looked at my paper and asked, “You don’t have a lot of circles on your paper. How many did you draw?” I replied, “10”. He asked again, “How many did you write that you were going to draw?”. I replied, “10”. He knew me well enough to know I would pull this stunt. He almost broke out into laugher and exposed me. See, I am not the kind of person that runs after doing more than needed. I don’t want to do more especially if I know this is rolling a boulder up a hill just to have it come down again. That was a futile exercise with nothing to gain. For me, in 30 seconds, there was no point in drawing more than 10 circles. So, I thought, how many should I draw? 10 should be fine. In fact, 10 is 9 more than required. For me, I knew drawing more or less would not amount to anything more in life. Even in 9th grade, I was not motivated to do Sisphyian tasks.

But, then we need to look at all those people in the room. All those who defined their limitations because others asked what it was. And they were quick to break it just to prove to others that they are better than the limitations that they set. There were people in a race. To draw the most circles in 30 seconds. They were ready to roll the boulder up the hill. Just for a momentary win of saying, yes, I rolled the boulder up the hill and I made it to the top. I made 140 circles in 30 seconds when I thought I could not make over 60. I understand that there are a lot of people like this in the world. People who find gratification in taking a boulder up a hill, just to find that there is another hill they need to climb. For me, I just would leave the boulder at the base, climb to the top, and stare into the sunset. Maybe stare into the abyss.
