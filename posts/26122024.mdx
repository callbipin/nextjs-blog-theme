# Lights went out

26th December

The lights went out and then came back again. Then it went out again. My mum is outside with the same question she always has, “Is it just our house, or did lights go off everywhere?” And more often than not, the whole society is facing load-shedding. There used to be a time when we had 16 hours of load-shedding in Nepal. With the rise in demand, low rainwater in the winter, and corrupt politicians looking to make a buck, we may again be on the verge of not having electricity when we most need it.

My Dad walked in on me, and now I have lost the pace of what I was trying to do. But if I look at it objectively, I can’t know for certain what I am trying to do. I am trying to write, enunciate, vomit, and splurge my words, letters, and sentences to make meaning out of this incoherent gargle. Why do I do this? Is this an exercise, or is this just self-torture?

Stephen King wrote a copious number of books. More so than many writers have in their lifetime. This begs the question, “How did he do it?” And the answer is rather simple. In an interview, he was asked, “How do you write such books so fast?”. To this, he replied, “I don’t try to write much per day but only six pages”. I may have written it in quotations, but I am paraphrasing here. The original transcript of the interview may not match. But, back to the point at hand. His method was rather simple. Write six pages a day, nor one page more nor one page less. I doubt he stuck to this religiously but this gives us an idea about what one must do.

Let’s scrutinise King’s habit a bit more to get a glimpse of what helped him to become the best of the best in not just quality but quantity. He was a writer who wrote a mere six pages a day, but he made sure those six pages were perfect. This means the words, diction, emotion, characters, their development, the prose, the tone, the setting, and the writing all must be close to perfect in those six pages. That was his task for a day. To get those six pages correct. When thinking of writing the perfect book, it sounds like a monumental task. On the other hand, if I were to ask you to just write six pages today then the task seems much simpler to do.

I got distracted again. My phone pinged again, and alas me being the slave I am to technology, notifications, and a constant murmur of new things happening that excite me no more, I looked at my phone. A person asked what makes a girl attractive. I mean, girl, if you have to ask. But, I understand not all have the same level of understanding of themselves and how to present it to the world. I say that being one of such person. Yet, I shall try to answer that nonetheless because why would I not give in to my desire to be the person who knows it all? What makes a person attractive indeed? Or, moreover, what turns a girl into a lady of beauty?

The first thing we need to throw out of the window is the idea that everyone is beautiful. No, not everyone is beautiful, but everyone can emanate beauty. Beauty, unlike pretty, is not dependent on factors such as facial harmony or the shade of your skin. Rather, if you look at the things considered most beautiful in the world, you will find a bit of deviation from the norm. Now, I understand I am deviating from the question but beauty is quite a rather fumble that one must aptly reply as to what it is for us to make proper understanding of it.

Beauty is the torrent of catharsis. You can’t help but see beauty and feel the emotions within you just pour out of you. This is not through malice or through entertainment. Beauty simply exists to caress you in her arms and then make you flow your being out of you. The inner child within you, the young boy that ran like there was no tomorrow, the young lass that danced the beat of the music, a seeking of what once was innocent and free.

Obviously, you need not agree with my definition of beauty, for seldom beauty asks to be described. That, too, is an individual preference. It defines itself in each person who sees the world differently. Now, I know what you are wondering, “Bipin, that’s all great and all but we were talking about personality. How does beauty come into this equation?” Well, my enthusiast reader willing to endure, the question asked was what makes a girl attractive. Through the gaze of the male species, when a person is able to see beauty in the personality of a girl, she transcends the plebeian ideas of beauty. When that graceful dance happens between how a person walks, talks, dances, prances, enhances the energy of the room, we see beauty. For quite some time the world has been stuck with false ideas of life. But once you read this, you will see this in every walk of life.

Words like beauty, grace, attraction, friendship, love, and hope are not mere things that happen. These are cosmic energies ever so tangling in between the real and ethereal. When one dives into seeking more than what one wants to find. When one doesn’t accept the definitions given to the world but chooses to define the world on what one observes, then the cosmic energies align with them. Then, they find what they have been seeking for: Beauty, Grace, Attraction, and all that the universe has to offer. For we believe this is a cruel world, for the universe believes, we are cruel to not embrace it.
